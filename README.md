# tap-gong

`tap-gong` is a Singer tap for [Gong.io](https://gong.io).
It is built with the Meltano [SDK](https://gitlab.com/meltano/sdk) for Singer Taps.

## Configuration

### Accepted Config Options

The Gong tap accepts the following configuration options:

- `access_key`: An API access key generated in Gong.
- `access_key_secret`: The secret for the access key.
- `start_date`: The beginning date from which to start searching calls. Default is python min date.
- `end_date`: The end date for searching calls. Default is current date.

** **NOTE** **
`start_date` and `end_date` are used in filter clause to make gong API calls and can not be greater than current date. Also `start_date` must be less than `end_date`.
